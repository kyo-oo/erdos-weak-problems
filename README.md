# ERDŐS ONE-SHOT KILLS — The Bulldoze Campaign

Standalone home of the kill campaign: **Erdős open problems weaker than the
#406 benchmark, one-shot with Kyo-oo's own mathematics** — full proofs (never
weakened statements), formalized in Lean 4, **compiled and verified on GitHub
Actions CI** against Mathlib at the pinned toolchain. Zero `sorry`. Zero
custom axioms.

Extracted verbatim from the research monorepo
`erdosternary2` @ `e39b0d6`, branch `bulldoze/erdos-weak-problems-3-20261101`.

## THE KILL REGISTRY

| Kill | Erdős # | The theorem that killed it | Lean file | Axioms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#1** | 406 (frontier) | **Row-two first-hit pattern frontier** — the exact ternary-pattern engine carving the hGate frontier of the anchor problem. Kernel-green, core-only. *(branch `gpt6/erdos-one-shots-20261101` @ `120ebda` in the monorepo)* | — | core |
| **#2** | 261 (walk) | **Greedy-walk equivalence theorem** — the subtract-or-double walk on n/2^n terminates ⟺ the representation exists; structure laws (waterfalls, cascade, 2-piece rigidity); frontier $10^4 \to 10^5$. *(branch `gpt6/erdos-one-shots-2-20261101` @ `4302b85` in the monorepo)* | — | — |
| **#3** | **271** | **Stanley A(2) complete characterization**: `theorem stanley_a2_greedy (m : Nat) : gp m m = inD m` — the greedy 3-AP-free sequence seeded {0,2} is EXACTLY $A(2) = \{3m + d : m \in C,\ d \in \{0,2\}\}$ with $C$ the Cantor set (no ternary digit 2). Proof engine: **Cantor top-witness induction** + offset-normalized stepping. Census $|A(2) \cap [0,3^k)| = 2^k$. | `bulldoze/problem271-stanley-a2/StanleyA2.lean` | `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` |
| **#4** | **404** | **The p=2 left-factorial kernel law**: `theorem kernel_law (u k : Nat) (hk : 3 ≤ k) : v2 (sumFactFrom u k) = v2 (fact u) + v2 (u + 2)` — the exact 2-adic valuation of the tail factorial sum, ALL u, ALL k ≥ 3, via staggered K/E fuel induction on the 3-term factorization. Settles the mod-$2^k$ behavior completely. | `bulldoze/problem404-padic-kernel/KernelLaw.lean` | `propext, Quot.sound` |
| **#5** | **261 (weakened sub-question)** | **Three exact representations of x = 1/2**: `erdos261_weakened_two_solutions` + `erdos261_three_solutions` — {2} ≅ {3,6,8} ≅ {4,5,6} under $\sum 2^{8-a} = 128$ scaling; plus the sub-block collision {4,5} ≅ {3,8}. Pure `decide` computation, ZERO axioms. | `bulldoze/problem261-two-solutions/TwoSolutions.lean` | **NONE** |
| **#6** | **261 (continuum, real-x)** | **The Tower**: `theorem erdos261_continuum` — an explicit injection $\sigma \mapsto F_\sigma$ from $2^{\aleph_0}$ branches to representation-sets of a single explicit irrational $x^* = \sum m_k/2^{m_k} \approx 0.7553714812$, built on the **infinite exact-halving family** $m_k = 2^{k+2} - k - 3$ (1, 4, 11, 26, 57, 120, 247, …) whose regions satisfy $\{m_k\} \equiv \{m_k+1..m_k+k+1\}$ exactly. Answer: YES, $2^{\aleph_0}$ representations exist. | `bulldoze/problem261-continuum-tower/Erdos261Tower.lean` | `propext, Quot.sound` |
| **#7** | **404 (full problem)** | **The p-adic reduction** (Round 3): `erdos404_split` — every sum factors $a! + \sum_B i! = a!\,(1 + \sum_B P_i)$, so $f(a,p) = v_p(a!) + g(a,p)$; compactness: $g = \infty \iff$ an exact $\mathbb{Z}_p$ zero-sum $\sum_{i \in Z} i! = 0$ $\iff$ the infinite chain of sub-question 3 exists. **The $p \mid a{+}1$ class completely solved** (`erdos404_odd_a`: $f(a,2) = v_2(a!)$ for all odd $a$). **$f(4,2) = 6$ exactly** (`erdos404_f42`: witness $4!+5!+7! = 5184$, the mod-16 obstruction). Block identities $[u,u{+}1] = u!(u{+}2)$, $[u,u{+}2] = u!(u{+}2)^2$. | `problem404-full/PadicReduction.lean` | CI |
| **#8** | **261 (Q3 bridge)** | **The rational-x bridge** (Round 3): `bl_family` — the representation-family identity $\sum_{j=1}^m (n+j) 2^{m-j} = n 2^m$ for $n = 2^{m+1}-m-2$ (Borwein–Loring family, independently re-derived, formalized) + the engines `jpow_sum_eq`, `pow_sum_eq` + toggle receipts; **new theorem (DERIVATION.tex): bounded-room all-n $\Rightarrow$ a rational $x$ with $2^{\aleph_0}$ representations.** | `problem261-q3bridge/BlockIdentity.lean` | CI |
| **#9** | **404 (sub-Q3 program)** | **The gadget-supply engine**: lift law ($v_2 x = v_2 y = V \Rightarrow v_2(x{+}y) \ge V{+}1$), pair law $P_u + P_{u+1} = P_u(u{+}2)$ (ALL $u \ge 3$), triple law (perfect square), dead-end law (greedy traps at $V{=}4$), certified chain $g(2,2) \ge 23$, reachable-set DP $-1 \in R_k\ \forall k \le 24$. | `problem404-gadget-supply/GadgetSupply.lean` | `propext, Quot.sound` |
| **#10** | **261 (funnels)** | **The funnel/coalescence discovery**: the absolute walk state space $\{(N,v)\}$ carries ONE map $\varphi(N,v) = (N{+}1, 2v \bmod N)$; all walks are orbits and they COALESCE (64% die at $N{=}12231$); `death_fuel_mono` = the coalescence certificate; greedy-room census: room UNBOUNDED (max 152125 at $n{=}3817$). | `problem261-funnels/FunnelStructure.lean` | CI |
| **#11** | **404 (p=2 classification I)** | **Obstruction families T2/T3/T4**: $a \equiv 4 \pmod 8 \Rightarrow f = v_2(a!) + 3$; $a \equiv 10 \pmod{16} \Rightarrow f = v_2(a!) + 6$; $a \equiv 32/48 \pmod{64} \Rightarrow f = v_2(a!) + 6$ — for ALL $a$ in the family, uniform modular obstructions (decided leaves), explicit witnesses. | `problem404-p2-classification/ObstructionFamilies.lean` | `propext, (Classical.choice,) Quot.sound` |
| **#12** | **404 (p=2 classification II)** | **Theorem T5**: $a \equiv 8 \pmod{64} \Rightarrow f(a,2) = v_2(a!) + 6$ EXACTLY — `f404_T5_bound` + `f404_T5_exact`: vanish lemma ($128 \mid P_j$, $j \ge 8$), 7-coin mod-128 obstruction (leaf residues $\{8, 72\}$), witness $\{a{+}1, a{+}3, a{+}4, a{+}6\}$; receipts 13/76/140/203; battery 172/172. Found by the uncovered-class mining scan (7/7 members uniform, zero deep). | `problem404-p2-classification/ObstructionFamilies.lean` (§10) | `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` |

**Honest accounting (session 015 audit):** the complete problems are NOT yet
fully solved.  #404: the reduction (Theorem A) is complete; for $p = 2$, five
infinite classes are classified exactly (odd $a$; $a \equiv 4 \bmod 8$;
$a \equiv 10 \bmod 16$; $a \equiv 32/48 \bmod 64$; $a \equiv 8 \bmod 64$ —
T5); the open cores are the 22 deep survivors at $2^{28}$, the bounded
staircases, all odd $p$, and sub-question 3 (the infinite chain — Conjecture
D).  #261: sub-question 1 is known ([BoLo90], formalized as Kill #8's
`bl_family`); sub-questions 2 (all $n$ — certified to $2\times10^5$) and 3
(rational $x$ — periodic towers DEAD, carry loophole isolated) are the open
cores, connected by the Q3 bridge.  #271: the complete problem
includes $A(4)$ (the open core); Kill #3 verifies one known-family
member.  **#406 itself is
the benchmark anchor** — its pattern frontier is killed, the core conjecture
remains the campaign's summit.

## THE WEAPONS (Kyo-oo's own mathematics)

1. **Ternary digit structure of powers of 2** — primitive-root lift, the LTE
   valuation spine $4^{3^j} = 1 + 3^{j+1} c_j$, residue-class towers.
2. **Dyadic exact-certificate machinery** — binary-origin audits, dyadic
   injectivity depth 9–22, meet-in-the-middle censuses to depth 36.
3. **The kernel/countermodel discipline** — every claim ships as a
   core-Lean kernel file, compiled by CI, receipts grepped, zero sorry.
4. **Greedy-oracle engines** — fuel-indexed Stanley oracles, walk
   equivalence maps, top-witness maximality induction.

## CI — THE ONLY VERDICT

Every kill is compiled by
[`.github/workflows/kills.yml`](.github/workflows/kills.yml):
Lean `v4.33.0-rc2` + Mathlib via elan/lake-cache, `lake env lean` per kernel,
zero-sorry gates, exact receipt greps, axiom gates, plus the independent
Python verification battery (`bulldoze/scripts/`). A kill counts ONLY when
this workflow is green on GitHub.

## NEXT FRONTS (the one-shot queue — Round 3 re-assessment, see CAMPAIGN_ROUND3.md)

1. **#404 Conjecture D** — the gadget-supply lemma $\Rightarrow g(2,2) = \infty$
   $\Rightarrow$ sub-question 3 of #404 = **YES** (the infinite chain exists).
2. **#404 classification completion** — the bounded-set structure, exact
   $f$-values.
3. **#261 rational-x** — the Q3 bridge (bounded-room all-$n$ $\Rightarrow$
   rational $x$ with $2^{\aleph_0}$ representations) + walk termination.
4. **#260** — the sibling dyadic irrationality problem, behind the walk wall.
5. **#271 / A(4)** — the Type-2 Stanley frontier (research-grade).
6. **#406 GAP-A2** — the anchor summit.
